# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct (v3.0 Adaptation)

## Our Pledge

We pledge to make our community welcoming, safe, and equitable for all.

We are committed to fostering an environment that respects and promotes the dignity, rights, and contributions of all individuals, regardless of characteristics including (but not limited to) race, ethnicity, caste, color, age, physical characteristics, neurodiversity, disability, sex or gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, language, philosophy or religion, national or social origin, socio-economic position, level of education, or any other status. The same privileges of participation are extended to everyone who participates in good faith and in accordance with this Covenant.

## Our Standards (Encouraged Behaviors)

We strive to act in ways that center our shared values, including:

- Respecting the **purpose of our community**, its activities, and spaces.
- Engaging **kindly and honestly** with others.
- Respecting **different viewpoints** and experiences.
- **Taking responsibility** for our actions and impact.
- Gracefully giving and accepting **constructive feedback**.
- Committing to **repairing harm** when it occurs.
- Behaving in ways that promote and sustain the **well-being of our community**.

## Unacceptable (Restricted) Behaviors

The following behaviors (including attempts and threats) are violations of this Code of Conduct:

1. **Harassment**: Violating explicitly expressed boundaries or persisting in unwanted interaction after a clear request to stop.
2. **Character attacks**: Insulting, demeaning, or pejorative comments directed at individuals or groups.
3. **Stereotyping / discrimination** based on any protected or personal characteristic.
4. **Sexualization**: Inappropriate sexual attention or advances.
5. **Violation of privacy**: Sharing or acting on someone’s personal / private information without consent (doxxing).
6. **Endangerment**: Encouraging, threatening, or committing violence or other harm.
7. **Other conduct** that threatens the well-being of our community or its members.

Additional restrictions:

- **Misleading identity** or impersonation, including attempts to evade enforcement.
- **Failure to credit sources** for contributed content.
- **Irrelevant promotion / spam** outside normal collaboration.
- **Irresponsible communication** involving or amplifying any restricted behaviors above.

## Reporting an Issue

Not every conflict is a Code of Conduct violation. This document helps identify and minimize harmful patterns. If you believe a violation has occurred:

- Email the maintainers at: `conduct@yourdomain.example` (replace with the correct address)  
  OR open a private GitHub discussion if enabled.
- Provide: (a) description of incident, (b) where it occurred (URL/context), (c) identities (if known), (d) any supporting screenshots or logs.
- Reports will be handled as promptly as possible. We strive to acknowledge within 5 business days.

We will respect confidentiality requests to protect reporters and impacted individuals. False or bad‑faith reports may themselves be treated as violations.

## Enforcement & Remediation

Community Moderators (project maintainers or designated reviewers) are responsible for clarifying and enforcing this Code of Conduct.

Enforcement ladder (steps may be skipped depending on severity):

1. **Warning**  
   - Private written notice describing the violation.  
   - Possible repair: acknowledgement, private apology, clarification request.
2. **Temporarily Limited Activities**  
   - Short “cooldown” restricting certain interactions (PR reviews, discussions, etc.).  
   - Repair: reflection period; considered re-entry.
3. **Temporary Suspension**  
   - Removal from collaboration spaces for a defined period with conditions for return.  
   - Repair: acceptance of responsibility; honoring suspension terms.
4. **Permanent Ban**  
   - Removal from all project channels (rare; for severe or repeated violations).  
   - No return path if community safety cannot be assured.

Enforcement decisions are final at the discretion of the moderation team, guided by community safety and fairness.

## Appeals

If you believe an enforcement action was made in error, you may send a concise appeal (max 500 words) to the reporting address within 14 days. A different maintainer (not originally involved) will review when feasible.

## Scope

This Code applies in all project spaces (GitHub issues, PRs, discussions, code review, chats, events) and when individuals represent the project publicly (conference talks, social media, etc.).
